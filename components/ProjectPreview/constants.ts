        description: `The LFGTV project is my most prized project to date. The inital concept was
        a DJ specific livestreaming platform built in response to Twitch's growing concerns
        over copywritten music being played on air leading them to severly restrict what, when,
        and how DJs were able to play their music on the platform. 
        \n\n
        During my time at Patterson Labs, we were approached by the owner of LFG who was looking
        for a design drafted in Figma and delivered within two weeks. After learning that their launch date
        was quickly arriving in just a few months, and not even a prototype was functional, we accepted our
        small portion of the project and began working shortly thereafter.
        \n\n
        After a couple days of brainstorming and a few days of drafting, I delivered the completed design
        which was electrically received. So well recieved that the owner purposed we join their team and help
        implement it. Always up for a new task, we accepted and began creating a livestreaming platform
        essentially from the ground up. 
        \n\n
        Over the following five months our team of four engineers poured our hearts into the project spending 
        countless hours implementing, brainstorming, and constructing the most modern, sleek, functional 
        livestreaming platform our expertice would allow. 
        \n\n
        Throughout the project I learned a plethora of new tech including HLS video formats, real-time data 
        transmission with websockets, SSR with Next.js. I also had the pleasure of working with two incredibly
        talented engineers who not only taught me knowledge about my craft, but also gave me invaluable
        knowledge about our industry in Computer Science.
